Team Members: Junchi Tian, Jingshu Song, Yiming Dong

# Introduction

For this final project, we used a recently released dataset of Kannada digits. Kannada is the official and administrative language of the state of Karnataka in India with nearly 60 million speakers worldwide. The language has roughly 45 million native speakers and is written using the Kannada script. Distinct glyphs are used to represent the numerals 0-9 in the language that appear distinct from the modern Hindu-Arabic numerals in vogue in much of the world today. The following picture shows the figure of Kannada.
